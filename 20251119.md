In youtube_clone project, when making `VideoCard.jsx`, we get

```
<Card sx={{width:{md:'320px', xs: "100%"}, boxShadow: 'none', borderRadius: 0}} >
  ...
</Card>
```
Here:

1. ```sx``` is style props of ```Card``` (MUI component)
   
   1.1 ```width``` determines width of ```Card```, ```md``` is medium or large screen device (eg laptop) and we set it to ```320px``` here. ```xs``` is extreme-small screen device (eg mobile phone), we set it to ```100%``` because we want the ```Card``` fully fit the whole phone screen.

   1.2 ```boxshadow: 'none'``` eliminates shadow surrounding the box

   1.3 ```borderRadius: 0``` makes box square instead of round


```
<Link to={`channel/${channelDetail?.id?.channelId}`}>
...
</Link>
```
Here:

```Link``` component with prop ```to``` that determines which URL the component jump to. ```{channel/${channelDetail?.id?.channelId}}``` is an URL starts with```channel```, other parts just as you see.


```
<CardMedia 
             image={channelDetail?.snippet?.thumbnails?.high?.url || demoProfilePicture}
             alt={channelDetail?.snippet?.title}
             sx={{borderRadius: '50%', height: '180px', width: '180px'}}
          />
```

Here:
```CardMedia``` is given ```image```, ```alt``` and ```sx```. ```image``` gives it a picture from URL ```channelDetail?.snippet?.thumbnails?.high?.url || demoProfilePicture``` and if image cannot be display normally, ```alt``` (title of snippet) will show up.
